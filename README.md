# Common Gate Amplifier
<br>
A common-gate amplifier is a single-stage field-effect transistor (FET) amplifier topology that's used as a voltage amplifier or current buffer. It's one of three basic FET amplifier topologies. <BR><BR>
<h2>I. A common gate amplifier has several advantages, including :</h2><BR>
1. Low output impedance: Common gate amplifiers have a high input impedance and a low output impedance, making them useful as buffers.<BR>
2. High input impedance: When used with a JFET, a common gate amplifier can have a high input impedance, low noise levels, and a wide voltage input range.<BR>
3. Unity current gain: Common gate amplifiers have unity voltage gain, but high current gain.<BR>
4. In-phase input and output signals: The input and output signals of a common gate amplifier are in phase. <BR>
