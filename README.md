# Common Base Amplifier
<br>
A common-base amplifier is a single-stage bipolar junction transistor (BJT) amplifier topology that's commonly used as a voltage amplifier or current buffer. It's also known as a grounded base amplifier. <BR><BR>
<h2>I. A common base amplifier has several advantages, including :</h2><BR>
1. High isolation: The output has little feedback to the input, which leads to high stability.<BR>
2. Low input impedance: This can be an advantage when the source has a low impedance and good power transfer is needed into the amplifier.<BR>
3. Current gain of unity: This makes the common base amplifier useful as a current buffer.<BR>
4. Non-inverting voltage gain: The input and output phases are identical.<BR>
5. Performance at higher frequencies: Common base amplifiers perform well at higher frequencies, which is useful for some applications. <BR>
